**Introduction HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure)** are the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. They define how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands. 

---
### History 
- **1989-1991**: Tim Berners-Lee develops HTTP at CERN as part of the World Wide Web project 
- **1996**: HTTP/1.0 formalized in RFC 1945 
- **1997**: HTTP/1.1 introduced in RFC 2068 (updated in RFC 2616 and later RFC 7230-7235) 
- **2015**: HTTP/2 standardized in RFC 7540 
- **2022**: HTTP/3 standardized in RFC 9114 ## HTTP Basics HTTP is an application layer protocol that operates on a client-server model. 
---

### Key Characteristics 
- **Stateless**: Each request from a client to server is treated as a new request with no memory of previous requests 
- **Client-Server Model**: Communication always initiated by the client (typically a web browser) 
- **Text-based** (HTTP/1.x): Messages are human-readable (HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 use binary formats) 
- **Port 80**: Standard port for HTTP communication 
- **Connectionless** (HTTP/1.0): Each request/response pair requires a new TCP connection 
- **Persistent Connections** (HTTP/1.1+): Multiple requests can use the same connection 
---

### HTTP Communication Flow 
1. Client establishes a connection to the server 
2. Client sends an HTTP request 
3. Server processes the request 
4. Server returns an HTTP response 
5. Connection is maintained or closed depending on headers and HTTP version 

## HTTP Request Structure An HTTP request consists of: 
1. **Request line**: Contains the method, URI, and HTTP version 
2. **Headers**: Metadata about the request 
3. **Empty line**: Indicates the end of headers 
4. **Body** (optional): Contains data sent to the server ### Example Request ``` GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 Host: www.example.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br Connection: keep-alive Cookie: session=abc123; preference=dark ``` 

## HTTP Response Structure An HTTP response consists of: 
1. **Status line**: Contains HTTP version, status code, and reason phrase 
2. **Headers**: Metadata about the response 
3. **Empty line**: Indicates the end of headers 
4. **Body** (optional): Contains the requested resource ### Example Response ``` HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Mon, 19 May 2025 23:15:42 GMT Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu) Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Content-Length: 1234 Last-Modified: Wed, 14 May 2025 12:10:15 GMT ETag: "31415926535-1234-20250514121015" Cache-Control: max-age=3600 Connection: keep-alive```
<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Example Page</title> </head> <body> <h1>Hello, World!</h1> <!-- Rest of the HTML content --> </body> </html> ``` 

### HTTP Methods HTTP defines several request methods (also called "verbs") that indicate the desired action to be performed on the identified resource. 
| Method | Description | Properties | Common Use Cases | |--------|-------------|------------|------------------| | GET | Retrieve data | Safe, Idempotent, Cacheable | Fetching web pages, API data retrieval | | POST | Submit data | Not safe, Not idempotent, Not cacheable | Form submissions, creating resources | | PUT | Replace a resource | Not safe, Idempotent, Not cacheable | Updating resources with complete replacement | | DELETE | Remove a resource | Not safe, Idempotent, Not cacheable | Removing resources | | HEAD | GET without body | Safe, Idempotent, Cacheable | Checking if resource exists or has changed | | OPTIONS | Get supported methods | Safe, Idempotent, Not cacheable | CORS preflight, API capability discovery | | PATCH | Partial update | Not safe, Not idempotent, Not cacheable | Partial resource updates | | TRACE | Echo request | Safe, Idempotent, Not cacheable | Debugging | | CONNECT | Tunnel connection | Not safe, Not idempotent, Not cacheable | Setting up SSL tunnels | ### Properties Explained - **Safe**: Does not alter the server state - **Idempotent**: Multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request - **Cacheable**: Response can be cached for future use ## HTTP Status Codes Status codes indicate the result of the HTTP request. ### Categories - **1xx**: Informational - Request received, continuing process - **2xx**: Success - Request successfully received, understood, and accepted - **3xx**: Redirection - Further action needed to complete the request - **4xx**: Client Error - Request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled - **5xx**: Server Error - Server failed to fulfill a valid request ### Common Status Codes | Code | Message | Description | |------|---------|-------------| | 200 | OK | Request succeeded | | 201 | Created | Resource created successfully | | 204 | No Content | Request succeeded but no content returned | | 301 | Moved Permanently | Resource permanently moved to a new URL | | 302 | Found | Resource temporarily moved to a different URL | | 304 | Not Modified | Resource has not changed since last request | | 400 | Bad Request | Server cannot process due to client error | | 401 | Unauthorized | Authentication required | | 403 | Forbidden | Server refuses to authorize request | | 404 | Not Found | Requested resource not found | | 405 | Method Not Allowed | HTTP method not allowed for this resource | | 429 | Too Many Requests | Client has sent too many requests | | 500 | Internal Server Error | Generic server error | | 502 | Bad Gateway | Server acting as gateway received invalid response | | 503 | Service Unavailable | Server temporarily unavailable | | 504 | Gateway Timeout | Gateway timeout waiting for response | ## HTTP Headers Headers provide additional information about the request or response. ### Common Request Headers | Header | Description | Example | |--------|-------------|---------| | Accept | Media types the client can process | `Accept: text/html,application/json` | | Accept-Encoding | Compression algorithms supported | `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate` | | Authorization | Authentication credentials | `Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOi...` | | Cache-Control | Caching directives | `Cache-Control: no-cache` | | Connection | Connection management | `Connection: keep-alive` | | Content-Type | Format of the request body | `Content-Type: application/json` | | Cookie | Stored HTTP cookies | `Cookie: session=abc123` | | Host | Domain name of the server | `Host: www.example.com` | | User-Agent | Client application information | `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0)` | | Referer | URL of the previous web page | `Referer: https://www.google.com` | ### Common Response Headers | Header | Description | Example | |--------|-------------|---------| | Access-Control-Allow-Origin | CORS header | `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` | | Cache-Control | Caching directives | `Cache-Control: max-age=3600` | | Content-Encoding | Compression used | `Content-Encoding: gzip` | | Content-Length | Size of the response body | `Content-Length: 1234` | | Content-Type | Format of the response body | `Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8` | | Date | Date and time of the response | `Date: Mon, 19 May 2025 23:15:42 GMT` | | ETag | Resource version identifier | `ETag: "31415926535-1234"` | | Expires | Date/time after which response is stale | `Expires: Tue, 20 May 2025 23:15:42 GMT` | | Last-Modified | Date/time resource was last modified | `Last-Modified: Wed, 14 May 2025 12:10:15 GMT` | | Location | URL for redirection | `Location: https://www.example.com/new-page` | | Server | Server software information | `Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)` | | Set-Cookie | Sets an HTTP cookie | `Set-Cookie: session=abc123; Path=/; HttpOnly` | ## HTTP Versions ### HTTP/1.0 (1996) - Basic functionality with methods, headers, and status codes - New connection for each request-response pair - Limited caching capabilities ### HTTP/1.1 (1997) - Persistent connections (keep-alive) - Chunked transfer encoding - Additional caching mechanisms - Host header (allowing virtual hosting) - Additional methods (PUT, DELETE, etc.) - Content negotiation ### HTTP/2 (2015) - Binary protocol instead of text-based - Multiplexing (multiple requests over a single connection) - Header compression (HPACK) - Server push (server can send resources before they're requested) - Request prioritization - Designed for lower latency ### HTTP/3 (2022) - Based on QUIC transport protocol over UDP (not TCP) - Improved connection establishment (0-RTT) - Better performance on unreliable networks - Independent streams (no head-of-line blocking) - Built-in encryption (TLS 1.3) - Improved mobility support ## HTTPS (HTTP Secure) HTTPS is HTTP with an added security layer using SSL/TLS. ### Key Characteristics - **Encrypted communications**: Prevents eavesdropping - **Data integrity**: Prevents data tampering - **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of the website - **Port 443**: Standard port for HTTPS communication - **URLs**: Begin with "https://" - **Visual indicators**: Padlock icon in browsers ### How HTTPS Works 1. **Client Hello**: Browser connects to HTTPS server and sends supported cipher suites 2. **Server Hello**: Server chooses cipher suite and sends certificate 3. **Certificate Verification**: Browser verifies certificate with Certificate Authority 4. **Key Exchange**: Secure symmetric key is established 5. **Encrypted Communication**: Data is encrypted using the symmetric key ### SSL/TLS Handshake Process ``` Client Server | | | ClientHello (supported ciphers, random1) | |---------------------------------------------->| | | | ServerHello (chosen cipher, random2) | | Certificate | |<----------------------------------------------| | | | ClientKeyExchange (encrypted pre-master key) | | ChangeCipherSpec | | Finished | |---------------------------------------------->| | | | ChangeCipherSpec | | Finished | |<----------------------------------------------| | | | Application Data (encrypted) | |<--------------------------------------------->| | | ``` ### SSL/TLS Versions - **SSL 2.0** (1995): Deprecated due to security flaws - **SSL 3.0** (1996): Deprecated due to POODLE vulnerability - **TLS 1.0** (1999): Deprecated due to various vulnerabilities - **TLS 1.1** (2006): Deprecated due to various vulnerabilities - **TLS 1.2** (2008): Widely used, considered secure with proper configuration - **TLS 1.3** (2018): Current version with improved security and performance ## Cookies and Sessions Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the browser that help maintain state in the stateless HTTP protocol. ### Cookie Attributes - **Name=Value**: The data stored in the cookie - **Domain**: Specifies which domains can receive the cookie - **Path**: Limits the cookie to specific paths on the server - **Expires/Max-Age**: Sets when the cookie should be deleted - **Secure**: Cookie only sent over HTTPS connections - **HttpOnly**: Prevents JavaScript access to the cookie - **SameSite**: Controls when cookies are sent with cross-site requests ### Example Set-Cookie Header ``` Set-Cookie: session=abc123; Path=/; Domain=example.com; Expires=Wed, 21 May 2025 07:28:00 GMT; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict ``` ### Session Management 1. **Server creates session**: Generates unique session ID 2. **Server sends session cookie**: Via Set-Cookie header 3. **Client stores cookie**: In browser storage 4. **Client sends cookie**: With each subsequent request 5. **Server identifies user**: By looking up session ID ## Caching HTTP caching mechanisms reduce latency and network traffic. ### Cache-Control Directives | Directive | Description | Example | |-----------|-------------|---------| | max-age | Maximum time in seconds to cache | `Cache-Control: max-age=3600` | | s-maxage | Max age for shared caches | `Cache-Control: s-maxage=7200` | | no-cache | Must revalidate before using cached copy | `Cache-Control: no-cache` | | no-store | Don't cache at all | `Cache-Control: no-store` | | public | Response can be cached by any cache | `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400` | | private | Response only for single user | `Cache-Control: private, max-age=3600` | | must-revalidate | Must verify stale resources | `Cache-Control: must-revalidate` | | immutable | Content won't change | `Cache-Control: max-age=31536000, immutable` | ### ETag and Conditional Requests 1. **Server sends ETag**: `ETag: "33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9f25f89d4"` 2. **Client stores ETag**: With the cached response 3. **Client sends conditional request**: `If-None-Match: "33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9f25f89d4"` 4. **Server checks if resource changed**: - If unchanged: Returns `304 Not Modified` (no body) - If changed: Returns `200 OK` with new content and ETag ## Content Negotiation Content negotiation allows the client and server to determine the most appropriate representation of a resource. ### Negotiation Headers - **Accept**: Media types (MIME types) the client can process - **Accept-Language**: Natural languages the client prefers - **Accept-Encoding**: Content encodings the client can handle - **Accept-Charset**: Character sets the client can handle ### Example Request: ``` GET /document HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br ``` Response: ``` HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Content-Language: en-US Content-Encoding: gzip Vary: Accept, Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding ``` ## Authentication HTTP provides several authentication mechanisms. ### Basic Authentication 1. **Server requests authentication**: `WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="User Visible Realm"` 2. **Client sends credentials**: `Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==` (base64 encoded username:password) ### Bearer Token Authentication Used with OAuth 2.0 and JWT: ``` Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c ``` ### Digest Authentication More secure than Basic Authentication: ``` Authorization: Digest username="user", realm="example.com", nonce="dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093", uri="/api/resource", response="6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1" ``` ### OAuth 2.0 Flow 1. **Client requests authorization**: Redirects user to authorization server 2. **User authenticates**: Grants permissions to the client 3. **Authorization server issues code**: Redirects back to client 4. **Client exchanges code for token**: Sends code to token endpoint 5. **Client uses token**: Includes token in API requests ## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) CORS is a security feature that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the original page. ### Simple Requests For simple requests, the server includes: ``` Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Content-Length, X-Custom-Header ``` ### Preflight Requests For complex requests, the browser first sends an OPTIONS request: Request: ``` OPTIONS /api/data HTTP/1.1 Host: api.example.com Origin: https://app.example.com Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type, X-Custom-Header ``` Response: ``` HTTP/1.1 204 No Content Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://app.example.com Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, X-Custom-Header Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400 ``` ## Security Considerations ### Common HTTP Security Issues - **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: Intercepting unencrypted communications - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts into web pages - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Tricking users into making unwanted requests - **HTTP Response Splitting**: Exploiting header injection vulnerabilities - **Session Hijacking**: Stealing session cookies to impersonate users - **Open Redirects**: Redirecting users to malicious sites - **Content Sniffing**: Browser guessing content type leading to security issues ### Security Headers | Header | Purpose | Example | |--------|---------|---------| | Content-Security-Policy | Controls resources the browser can load | `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'` | | Strict-Transport-Security | Forces HTTPS connections | `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` | | X-Content-Type-Options | Prevents content type sniffing | `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` | | X-Frame-Options | Controls if page can be displayed in frames | `X-Frame-Options: DENY` | | X-XSS-Protection | Enables browser's XSS filter | `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` | | Referrer-Policy | Controls referrer information | `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` | | Permissions-Policy | Controls browser features | `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=()` | ### HTTPS Best Practices - Use TLS 1.2 or 1.3 only - Configure secure cipher suites - Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) - Use secure cookies - Obtain certificates from trusted CAs - Regularly rotate and update certificates - Redirect HTTP to HTTPS - Use proper certificate key lengths (RSA 2048+ bits) ## Performance Optimization ### HTTP Performance Techniques - **Minimize HTTP Requests**: Combine files, use sprites, inline critical resources - **Use HTTP/2 or HTTP/3**: For multiplexing and reduced latency - **Enable Compression**: Use gzip or Brotli compression - **Leverage Browser Caching**: Set appropriate cache headers - **Use CDNs**: Distribute content geographically closer to users - **Implement Resource Hints**: dns-prefetch, preconnect, preload, prefetch - **Optimize TLS**: Session resumption, OCSP stapling, optimized cipher suites - **Reduce Cookie Size**: Minimize data sent with every request ### Resource Hints ```html &lt;!-- DNS Prefetch --> <link rel="dns-prefetch" href="//example.com"> &lt;!-- Preconnect --> <link rel="preconnect" href="https://example.com"> &lt;!-- Preload --> <link rel="preload" href="style.css" as="style"> &lt;!-- Prefetch --> <link rel="prefetch" href="page2.html"> &lt;!-- Prerender --> <link rel="prerender" href="next-page.html">
