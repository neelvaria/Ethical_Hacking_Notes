## Introduction

**Wireshark** is a free and open-source packet analyzer used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education. It is widely regarded as the de facto standard for network protocol analysis.

## Key Features

- **Packet Capture**: Captures live network data from Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and more.
- **Deep Inspection**: Analyses hundreds of protocols, with more added regularly.
- **Live and Offline Analysis**: View data in real-time or open previously saved capture files.
- **Rich Display Filters**: Powerful filtering capabilities to focus on relevant traffic.
- **Export Options**: Export data to various formats (CSV, XML, JSON, plain text).
- **Color Coding**: Customizable coloring rules for quick visual analysis.
- **VoIP Analysis**: Specialized tools for analyzing Voice over IP traffic.
- **Cross-Platform**: Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Installation

- **Windows**: Download installer from [Wireshark.org](https://www.wireshark.org/).
- **macOS**: Available via Homebrew (`brew install wireshark`) or direct download.
- **Linux**: Install via package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install wireshark`).

---

## User Interface Overview

- **Menu Bar**: Access to file, edit, view, capture, analyze, statistics, and help options.
- **Main Toolbar**: Quick access to common actions (open, save, start/stop capture).
- **Packet List Pane**: Displays captured packets with summary info.
- **Packet Details Pane**: Hierarchical view of protocol layers for selected packet.
- **Packet Bytes Pane**: Raw data in hexadecimal and ASCII.
- **Status Bar**: Capture status, filters, and statistics.

## Capturing Packets

1. **Select Network Interface**: Choose the interface to capture traffic from.
2. **Start Capture**: Click the "Shark Fin" icon or `Capture > Start`.
3. **Apply Capture Filters (optional)**: Limit captured data (e.g., `tcp port 80`).
4. **Stop Capture**: Click the red square icon or `Capture > Stop`.
5. **Save Capture**: File > Save As (`.pcap` or `.pcapng` format).

## Filters

### Capture Filters

- Applied before capturing, limits what is recorded.
- Syntax is similar to tcpdump.
- **Examples**:
  - Capture only HTTP: `tcp port 80`
  - Capture traffic from IP: `host 192.168.1.1`
  - Capture only TCP: `tcp`

### Display Filters

- Applied after capture, for viewing specific packets.
- More powerful and flexible than capture filters.
- **Examples**:
  - Show only HTTP: `http`
  - Show packets from IP: `ip.src == 192.168.1.1`
  - Show TCP SYN packets: `tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0`

## Protocol Analysis

- **Protocol Hierarchy**: `Statistics > Protocol Hierarchy` shows protocol breakdown.
- **Follow Streams**: Right-click a TCP/UDP packet > "Follow TCP/UDP Stream" to view conversation.
- **Reassembly**: Wireshark can reassemble fragmented packets for easier analysis.

---
## Common Use Cases

- **Troubleshooting Network Issues**: Identify latency, dropped packets, or retransmissions.
- **Security Analysis**: Detect suspicious traffic, malware, or unauthorized access.
- **Protocol Development**: Debug and verify custom or standard protocol implementations.
- **Performance Analysis**: Measure throughput, latency, and network utilization.
- **Educational Purposes**: Learn about network protocols and packet structures.

---
## Tips & Best Practices

- **Run as Administrator/Root**: Required for capturing on some interfaces.
- **Limit Capture Size**: Use filters or set capture limits to avoid large files.
- **Anonymize Data**: Use Wireshark's tools to remove sensitive information before sharing captures.
- **Update Regularly**: New protocol support and bug fixes are released frequently.
- **Use Coloring Rules**: Highlight important traffic for faster analysis.

---
## Security Considerations

- **Sensitive Data**: Captures may contain passwords, cookies, or personal data.
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure you have permission to capture network traffic.
- **Malicious Traffic**: Be cautious when opening captures from untrusted sources.
